# Overview

This codebase provides an automated data pipeline for Proffast 2.2 (https://www.imk-asf.kit.edu/english/3225.php). Under the hood, it uses the Proffast Pylot (https://gitlab.eudat.eu/coccon-kit/proffastpylot.git, Commit b9f5d7040dfeb8be5dba9c9a314fe7ab6dd98a9f) to interact with Proffast.

We decided to include a copy of the Python codebase of the Proffast Pylot inside this repository, so we can slightly modify it and have less complexity due to Git Submodules or on-demand downloads.
