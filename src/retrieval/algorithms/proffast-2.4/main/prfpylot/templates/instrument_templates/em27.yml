# instrument parameters for the EM27/SUN spectrometers (for PROFFASTpreprocess)

# Semi FOV:
# This parameter can be calculated from the entry "Aperture Setting" of the 
# OPUS file:
# semiFOV [rad] = "Aperture Setting" / (2 * 418)

# 17 for EM27/SUN and IR Cube: 1.8 cm MPD,
# 181/182: 2.5 cm /3.0 cm MPD,
# 19 for VERTEX / INVENIO: 4.5 cm MPD,

# The preprocesser can handle recordings with two interferograms.
# If this is the case, select True. Otherwise select false.
# True/False
dual_ifg_recording: True

# The preprocessor can swap the channels of the interferogram.
# The first channel is the main channel and must cover wavenumber from ~12000 until ~5500 cm^-1
# The second channel must cover wavenumbers from ~5500 to 4000 cm^-1
# If this is vice versa, set swap_channels: True
# In short: 1st channel SN, second channel SM - otherwise choose swap_channels: True
swap_channels: False

# true/false
use_analytical_phase: False

# Select which channel should be used to generate which kind of file.
# 0: only generate SN from first channel
# 1: generate SN from first and SM from second channel
# 2: generate SN + SM from first channel
