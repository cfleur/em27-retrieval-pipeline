This is an optional input file to be located in the daily pT folder.
It provides information of the intraday variability of ground pressure
and temperature for the invers-code:

The specified time needs to refer to the same time zone as used in the OPUS file.

The pressure as measured at the observer needs to be inserted at hPa. The daily
average of the tabellated p should closely match with the ground pressure used
in the pcxs calculation (witin a few hPa).
 
For T, a T change between the reference T specified in the pcxs input needs
to be specified in the third column. Note that this dT is intended to describe
the change of the PBL T, this variation is significantly less than the T rise
measured at ground level during the day. If no information is available, use 0.0.
