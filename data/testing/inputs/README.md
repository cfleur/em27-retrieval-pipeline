All the data required to run and test the pipeline is stored inside the repository - with the exception of the interferogram files, because they would add ~ 122MB of data to the repository. The pytests download these interferograms automatically. The test interferograms can be manually downloaded from https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiDWAwmdQubVDviAoN1uoc/em27-retrieval-pipeline-test-interferograms-2024-09-12.tar.gz.
